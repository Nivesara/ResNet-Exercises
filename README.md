# ðŸ§  ResNet on MNIST â€“ Notebook Overview

This repository contains the notebook **`02_ResNet_minist.ipynb`**, where a **custom ResNet architecture** is applied to the **MNIST handwritten digits dataset** using PyTorch.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights from the Notebook

- âœ… **Custom ResNet model** built from scratch, adapted for MNIST's single-channel grayscale input
- âœ… Modified convolutional layers to handle MNISTâ€™s 28Ã—28 image size
- âœ… Implemented **residual blocks** to understand and leverage deep residual learning
- âœ… Complete training pipeline using the ResNet model on MNIST
- âœ… Visualized training and validation loss for performance tracking

---

## ðŸ“Š Result Summary

- ðŸ“ˆ The **ResNet model achieved ~98.5% test accuracy** on the MNIST dataset
- ðŸ“‰ Training and validation **loss steadily decreased** across epochs
- âœ… Residual connections helped avoid vanishing gradients and improved learning stability

---

## ðŸ“‰ Graph: Loss Curve

The notebook includes a plot showing:

- ðŸŸ¦ **Training Loss** vs ðŸŸ¥ **Validation Loss**
- A consistent drop in both curves, showing proper model convergence
- No signs of overfitting â€“ the model generalizes well on unseen data
